        Column 1: Substrate<b> column with substrate gene name and site. Note that
        non-phosphorylated peptides should also be in the format indicated i.e.
        gene name(None). However, the analysis tool can also handle substrate
        entries for non-phosphorylated peptides that are only gene names.
