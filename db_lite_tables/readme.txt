Note:

- Inhibitor examples generated from the MRC DB. The inhibitor targets are in the short-hand format.

- BindingDB examples have the full protein name for the target. This will make it more difficult as the short-hand
needs to be parsed (from Uniprot?) into the BindingDB inhibitor table. Will this be enough to link the tables?
