# Project specifications
## Core specifications
1. web application
    - developed locally
    - should be deployable to [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/)
        - free of charge if only resources in [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) are used
2. browse information about all human kinases
    - name
    - gene symbol
    - family
    - location in cell
    - known phosphosites
3. browse human kinase phosphorylation sites
    - genomic location
    - neighbouring sequence
4. background info about all known inhibitors of human kinases
    - name
    - chemical structure
    - kinases they are known to inhibit
5. allow user to upload quantitative phosphoproteomics data of the format provided in example file az20.tsv
    - summarise data graphically
    - provide estimate of relative activity of every human kinase in the sample
6. general
    - working prototype
    - interactive demonstration of functionality
    - would need to be passed to professional developers/web designers to turn into a fully polished web application
    - documentation provided 
        - within the program code
        - in a dedicated document
        - explain software structure
        - explain how it works

## Additional specifications
(for stuff we have added)
## Specifications wish list
(for stuff we think would be nice to add)
plot showing changes in peptides' phosphorylation, where you hover over peptides and get info about substrate, potential kinases
